Counties quiz
============

A quiz to teach the [ceremonial counties of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_counties_of_England).

Features
-----

* Keyboard driven
* Teaches where counties are, not just to list them (cf. [Sporcle](http://www.sporcle.com/games/g/englandgeocounties))
* Illustrates incorrect guesses

The map is the Wikipedia image [`English_ceremonial_counties_1998.svg`](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:English_ceremonial_counties_1998.svg) made by 'Nilfanion and Dr Greg' and is used under a Creative Commons license.

Future ideas

Interestingly, all the data for this quiz (the map, the list of counties, and their positions) comes from the vector image. The code doesn't contain any county specific information. Thus, it might be possible to create quizzes from any map on Wikipedia, assuming the objects in it are labelled. I'd like to make a web app that does this.
