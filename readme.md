All the data for this quiz (the map, the list of counties, and their positions) comes from Wikipedia, specifically the vector image [`English_ceremonial_counties_1998.svg`](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:English_ceremonial_counties_1998.svg). Potentially, it might be possible to make quizzes from *any* map on Wikipedia, assuming the regions are labelled.
